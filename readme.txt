Thesis Name: "DESIGN, PLANNING, AND CONTROL OF DUAL-ARM MOBILE MANIPULATOR FOR DEPALLETIZING TASKS"

Abstract:

The industrial logistic market increasingly needs autonomous systems capable of performing complex tasks in an environment that is still not fully digitalized: palletizing and de-palletizing, pick and place, and transport are just some of them. The problem of de-palletization is addressed in this thesis work, whose goal is designing and controlling a Dual-Arm Mobile Manipulator capable of replicating picking primitives inspired by human movements. Starting from the individual robots, a task-based manipulability analysis of the system shows us an efficient relative configuration of the robots. Subsequently, we create the model and implement a planning and control algorithm to synchronize the different loco-manipulation tasks. Thanks to four different simulations of possible scenarios, the effectiveness of the proposed system is confirmed.
